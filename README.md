###  *Electricity*

## Chapter Four - Anatomy of a Flashlight

The nature of the *electrical circuit* is based on the theory of the *electron theory*.

The *electron theory* says that _electricity derives from the movement of electrons_.

-> So what are electrons and why do they move?

---

We use the _model of atoms_ as the smallest unit all matter is made up of.

Every atom is composed of three types of particles: *neutrons, protons and electrons.*

We use the image of a little solar system with the electrons spinning around the neutrons and protons.

---

We use the _model of elements_ as to describe the unit formed by atoms of a single type.

Every element is defined by consisting of atoms with a *certain amount of protons, neutrons and electrons*.

There are 112 elements; each has a particular atomic number ranging from 1 to 112.

_The atomic number indicates the number of protons and electrons in the nucleus of each of the elements atom._

*Lithium has 3 electrons, 3 protons ans 4 neutrons; hence it's atomic number is 3.* 

---

We use the _model of molecules_ to describe the unit formed by atoms of multiple types.

*Water is composed of molecules that consist of two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen.*
*Salt is composed of molecules that consit of one atom of sodium and one atom of chlorine.*

---

We distinguish between *compounds* (hydrogen, oxygen, sodium and chlorine) and *mixtures* (Salt water) because the water and the salt maintain their own properties.

---

The number of electrons in an atom is usually the same as the number of protons.
In certain circumstances they are not.

-> That's how electricity happens:

---

We describe protons and electrons with a characteristic called *charge*.

Protons are said to have a positive charge.
Electrons are said to have a negative charge.
Neutrons have no charge, they are neutral.

*We describe the relationship between protons and electrons with the note that opposite charges attract and like charges repel.*

---

We call the power that is holding the protons within the nucleus *strong force*.
(If we split the nucleus we create nuclear energy.)

-> So protons and electrons are the happiest if they exist together in equal numbers.

---

If an inequality of protons and electrons arouse the atoms that is missing electrons tried to grab them from another atoms nearby, that one grabs one from another one nearby and so on.

-> The passage of electrons from atom to atom is what we call _electricity_

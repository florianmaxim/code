#### Common (connection/"rail"):

We talk about a *common connection or rail* when we have a shared path between different electrical routes 
in an electrical circuit. The two circular circuits still operate independently.

-> We still have a minimum of two wires for both directions. How can we reduce it even further?
-> One thing we learned about conductors: The larger the better.

=> Is there anything bigger on earth but the planet itself? Let's use it!

#### Ground:

We use the earth as a conductor by using objects that maintain a substantial contact with the earth.

TODO: Symbol

Electrical contact with the earth is called *earth* in GB or *ground* in the USA.

-> We simply replace one wire with a connection through the earth. This reduces the wires by half.

* "The electrons come out of the earth at your friend's house, go through the lightbulbs and wire, the switch
at your house, and then go into the positive terminal of the battery. Electrons from the negative terminal
of the battery go into the earth."

-> How do the electrons know where to go though?

=> Obviously they don't.

* The earth is a massive conductor of electricity, but it can also be viewed as both a source of and a repository
for electrons.*
* The earth is to electrons as an ocean is to drops of water.*
* The earth is a virtually limitless source of electrons and also a giant sink for electrons.*

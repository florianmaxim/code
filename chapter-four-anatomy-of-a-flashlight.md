###  *The Nature of Electricity*

## Chapter Four - Anatomy of a Flashlight

The nature of the *electrical circuit* is based on the theory of the *electron theory*.

The *electron theory* says that _electricity derives from the movement of electrons_.

-> So what are electrons and why do they move?

---

We use the _model of atoms_ as the smallest unit all matter is made up of.

Every atom is composed of three types of particles: *neutrons, protons and electrons.*

We use the image of a little solar system with the electrons spinning around the neutrons and protons.

---

We use the _model of elements_ as to describe the unit formed by atoms of a single type.

Every element is defined by consisting of atoms with a *certain amount of protons, neutrons and electrons*.

There are 112 elements; each has a particular atomic number ranging from 1 to 112.

_The atomic number indicates the number of protons and electrons in the nucleus of each of the elements atom._

*Lithium has 3 electrons, 3 protons ans 4 neutrons; hence it's atomic number is 3.* 

---

We use the _model of molecules_ to describe the unit formed by atoms of multiple types.

*Water is composed of molecules that consist of two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen.*
*Salt is composed of molecules that consit of one atom of sodium and one atom of chlorine.*

---

We distinguish between *compounds* (hydrogen, oxygen, sodium and chlorine) and *mixtures* (Salt water) because the water and the salt maintain their own properties.

---

The number of electrons in an atom is usually the same as the number of protons.
In certain circumstances they are not.

-> That's how electricity happens:

---

We describe protons and electrons with a characteristic called *charge*.

Protons are said to have a positive charge.
Electrons are said to have a negative charge.
Neutrons have no charge, they are neutral.

*We describe the relationship between protons and electrons with the note that opposite charges attract and like charges repel.*

---

We call the power that is holding the protons within the nucleus *strong force*.
(If we split the nucleus we create nuclear energy.)

-> So protons and electrons are the happiest if they exist together in equal numbers.

---

If an inequality of protons and electrons arouse the atoms that is missing electrons tried to grab them from another atoms nearby, that one grabs one from another one nearby and so on.

-> The passage of electrons from atom to atom is what we call _electricity_.

-> How can we create an inequality of protons and electrons to start the movement of electrons?

---

We describe batteries as devices in which chemical reactions take place that break down molecules into other molecules so 
they generate spare electrons on the side with a minus sign (anode) and demand extra electrons on the side with the plus sign (cathode).

-> The spare ones are making their way to that side that is missing some (since thei are obsessed with equality).

-> This way chemical energy is converted to electrical energy.

###  *Basic Principles of Electricity*

_Conductance_ 
Some substances are better than others carrying electricity (*conductors*). Their atoms have only one electron on their outer shell, so it's easier for them to jump over. The best conductors are copper, silver and gold.

_Resistence_
Some substances are more resistent to carry electricity(*resistors*). Their atoms have more electrons on their outer shell, so it's harder for them to jump over to another atom..

_Insulation_
Substances with a very high resistence are called *insultors*.

-> longer wire - high resistence
-> thicker wire - lower resistence

---

_Voltage (Volt)_
The *potential of doing work. 

_Current (Ampere)_
The number related to the number of electrons actually zipping around the circuit.

---

_Water/Pipes - Analogy_

* Current * : The _amount_ of water flowing through a pipe.
* Voltage * : The water's _pressure.
* Resistance * : The pipe's with (the smaller the pipe the larger the resistance.)

---

###  *Basic Laws of Electricity*

_Ohm's law_

``` I = E / R ```
(Current = Voltage / Resistance)

* Battery without any connection between the poles: HIGH Resistance*
1.5V / MUCH = NOTHING flows (no Ampere) 

* Battery without direkt connection between the poles: LOW Resistance*
1.5V / LITTLE = EVERTHING flow (much ampere)

Two batteries Ã  1.5 in series are 3 Volts in total and a lightbulb with a resistance of 4 Ohms:

3V / 4Ohm 
= 0.75 Ampere 
= 750 miliamperes
= 4.680.000.000.000.000.000 electrons flow through the lightbulb per second.

---

_Lightbulb_

If a wire has a low resistance, it can get hot and start to glow.

A lightbulb's wire is made of thungstens called a filament.
The low resistance causes it to heat up.
In open air it would burn. In the lightbulb vacuum it doenst, so it glows and gives off light.

---

_Wattage (Watt)_

``` P = E * I ```
Power = Volt * Ampere

3 Volts and 0.75amp = 3 * 0.75 = 2.25 watt

---

Either electricity flows or not.
Either the circuit is open or closed.

## This analogy to binary codes will come in very useful.

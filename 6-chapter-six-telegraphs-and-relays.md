### *The Phenomenon of Electromagnitism & Remarkable Devices of Electrical Engineerings*

## Chapter Six - Telegraphs and Relays

_Instantaneous communication until the 1800s:_

*As fas as your voice could carry*
*As far as your eye could see*

_Communication over distance(letter):_

*As long as a horse needs to ride*
*As long as a ship needs to sail*

-- But not both!

---

_The Basic idea of a Telegraph:_

*"You do something at one end of the wire that causes something to happen
at the other end of the wire."*

(This is exactly what a long distance flashlight represents. 
However a practical one wasn't ivented until 1879.)

-- So, smart minds made use of a phenomenon called _electromagnetism_ !

---

### *The Electromagnet and the Telegraph*

*"If you take an iron bar, wrap it in with a couple of hundred turns of thin wire, 
and then run a current through the wire, the iron becomes a magnet."*

-- Turning the switch on and off at one end causes the elctromagnet to
_do something at the other end._

-- The electromagnet became the foundation of the telegraph.

---

Something that could be done at the other end of the wire was bouncing a pen up and down.
(dots and dashed)

Something else that could be done at the other end of the wire was to produce a click noise.
(click-clack and click...clack)

### *Telegraph Connection Setups*

_One way_

As we learned earlier we can use the _earth as a giant conductor_ to construct 
such a telegraph setup over long distances with a single wire only.

_Two way_

Two way communications simply required another instance of the same setup
oriented the other way around.

---

-- The invention of the telegraph truly marks the beginning of modern communication.

*People were able to communicate further than the eye could see or the ear could hear.*
*People were able to communicate faster than a horse could ride or a ship could sail.

-- Still another big problem remained: _The resistance of long length wires._

---


### *The Relay*

_The obvious solution:_

Having a relay system: Every couple of hundred miles a person equipped with a sender and a receiver  
could receive a message and resend it.

_The obvious improvement:_

Replacing that person with a mechanism that resends the signal automatically:

*When an incoming current triggers the electromagnet, the electromagnet pulls down a flexible
strip of metal that acts like a switch turn on a outgoing current.*

-- The relay or 'repeater' was born.

---

## The relay is a switch that is turned on and off not by human hands but by a current. 

## You could actually assemble much of a computer with it.
